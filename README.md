# üöÄ Graph-Powered RAG

*Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Neo4j Knowledge Graphs*

## üéØ Overview

**Graph-Powered RAG** is an innovative project that demonstrates how to enhance traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by integrating Neo4j graph databases with vector embeddings. This hybrid approach combines the semantic understanding of vector search with the relationship-aware capabilities of graph databases, creating a more contextually rich and intelligent retrieval system.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîó Hybrid Retrieval System**: Combines vector similarity search with graph-based relationship traversal
- **üìä Knowledge Graph Construction**: Automatically transforms documents into structured knowledge graphs using LLMs
- **üß† Intelligent Entity Extraction**: Identifies and connects entities, relationships, and concepts from text
- **üîç Context-Aware Search**: Leverages graph relationships to provide more relevant and comprehensive answers
- **üé® Interactive Graph Visualization**: Built-in graph visualization using yFiles widgets
- **üê≥ Containerized Setup**: Easy deployment with Docker Compose

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Graph Database**: Neo4j 5.22.0 with APOC plugins
- **LLM Integration**: Ollama (Llama 3.2) for graph transformation and query processing
- **Vector Embeddings**: Nomic Embed Text for semantic similarity
- **Framework**: LangChain for orchestrating the RAG pipeline
- **Visualization**: yFiles Jupyter Graphs for interactive graph exploration
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Ollama running locally with Llama 3.2 and Nomic Embed Text models
- Python 3.8+ with Jupyter Notebook

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph-powered-rag.git
   cd graph-powered-rag
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Neo4j database**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This will build the custom Neo4j image from the `neo4j/Dockerfile` and start the container.

5. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file with your Neo4j credentials:
   ```env
   NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
   NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

6. **Install Ollama models**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2:latest
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
   ```

7. **Run the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook enhancing_rag_with_graph.ipynb
   ```

## üéÆ How It Works

### 1. **Document Processing**
The system begins by loading text documents and splitting them into manageable chunks using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. Each chunk is then processed by the Llama 3.2 model to extract entities, relationships, and construct a knowledge graph in Neo4j.

### 2. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
Using the LLMGraphTransformer, the system identifies:
- **Entities**: People, organizations, locations, concepts
- **Relationships**: Connections between entities with semantic meaning
- **Properties**: Additional metadata about entities and relationships

### 3. **Dual Retrieval System**
The hybrid approach employs two complementary retrieval methods:
- **Vector Search**: Finds semantically similar content using Nomic embeddings
- **Graph Traversal**: Explores entity relationships and connections using Cypher queries

### 4. **Enhanced Question Answering**
When processing queries, the system:
- Extracts entities from the user's question
- Queries the graph database for relevant entity neighborhoods
- Performs vector similarity search for additional context
- Combines both results to generate comprehensive answers

## üîç Example Use Cases

The project includes sample data about the Caruso family's culinary empire, demonstrating:

- **Family Genealogy**: Understanding relationships between family members like Giovanni, Maria, Antonio, and Nonna Lucia
- **Business Networks**: Tracking restaurant ownership and locations across different cities
- **Cultural Heritage**: Preserving and exploring Sicilian culinary traditions
- **Geographic Connections**: Linking locations like Santa Caterina, Rome, and the Amalfi Coast

## üìä Sample Queries

Try these example queries with the provided sample data:

- "Who is Nonna Lucia? Did she teach anyone about restaurants or cooking?"
- "What restaurants does the Caruso family own?"
- "Tell me about the connection between Sicily and the family's cooking traditions"
- "Where are the different family restaurants located?"

## üé® Visualization Features

The notebook includes interactive graph visualization that allows you to:
- **Explore Relationships**: Navigate the knowledge graph structure visually
- **Entity Analysis**: Understand connections between people, places, and concepts
- **Data Insights**: Discover patterns and relationships in your data
- **Interactive Navigation**: Click and explore different nodes and edges

## üê≥ Docker Configuration

The project uses a custom Neo4j Docker setup with:

**Custom Neo4j Image**: Built from the `neo4j/Dockerfile` with APOC plugins pre-installed
**Security Configuration**: Proper settings for APOC functions and procedures
**Data Persistence**: Volumes mapped to the `./data` directory for data preservation
**Environment Variables**: Configurable authentication and plugin settings

## üîß Customization

### Adding Your Own Data
1. Replace `Dummy_Data.txt` with your own text files
2. Adjust chunk size and overlap parameters in the text splitter:
   ```python
   text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=250, chunk_overlap=24)
   ```
3. Modify entity extraction prompts for domain-specific entities

### Model Configuration
- **Switch LLM Models**: Change the Ollama model in the ChatOllama initialization
- **Adjust Parameters**: Modify temperature and other generation parameters
- **Custom Embeddings**: Use different embedding models for various languages or domains

### Graph Schema Customization
- **Entity Types**: Modify the LLMGraphTransformer to recognize domain-specific entities
- **Relationship Types**: Customize relationship extraction for your use case
- **Property Extraction**: Add custom properties to entities and relationships
